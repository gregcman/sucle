cNBT is an NBT File (see NBT.txt) parser that doesn't
depend on the horrible slowdown that is the JRE and sticks to the C principle of
being as simple (and, consequently, as fast) as possible.

Currently implemented features:

 * Complete parsing of NBT files
 * Basic tree-manipulation
 * Pretty printing with indentation
 * Writing modified NBT structures back to a compressed file
 * Full error reporting and graceful recovery from corrupt files and trees

This project depends on libz for gzip decompressing and compressing, and a compiler
with C99 support.
